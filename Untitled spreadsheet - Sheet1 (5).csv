Our team wants to remind you that prevention is the key to keeping your pet parasite free. Parasites like heartworms, hookworms, roundworms, whipworms, fleas, and ticks cause serious illness in our cats and dogs. We use parasite preventatives to not only keep our pets safe, but to protect your family's health, as many parasites can be transmitted to people as well.

Patient: Yeah. OK. Alright, thank you.  
Agent: Yeah, If you do decide to walk in, probably the best time I would pick would be about 1:00, just because that's when we're coming back from lunch and so there's not like appointments beforehand. And so you probably have the best chance of having the least amount of weight then.  
Patient: OK, Alright, thanks.

Patient: No.  
Agent: OK, so we would have to do an exam to establish care since it is a medication that we're having to do. Umm, let me pull up just so I can give you accurate pricing as far as the cytopoint goes. And I'm curious how much that first exam is.  
Patient: Yes.  
Agent: Umm, so the exam itself is $59 and it would just be the first time that you would come in for the cytopoint that we would have to do the exam. And then that exam is technically good for a year after that. Umm, and then for a cytopoint. Let's see. Still. And you said, umm, between 60 and 70 lbs, correct?  
Patient: OK.  
Agent: The cytopoint itself would be about umm 156 to 160 and then the exam is the 59.

Patient: Good, we have a follow up we need. We finished the **** for Sawyer.  
Patient: Yeah. And, uh, Doctor Kahn wanted to do another UPC.  
Agent: Got it. OK, so posture can bring him in tomorrow between 8:00 and 10:00, preferably on the earlier side.  
Patient: Sure. Let me just get to my tomorrow real quick. I mean, realistically, like if we're just checking a UPCI, don't think Doctor Khan would necessarily need to see us.  
Agent: Umm, but what we can do is at least have Sawyer come in so I can get the urine from him here. And then I can send out the UPC.  
Patient: Oh, perfect. All right.  
Agent: Yeah. So, I mean, I'll put it at like, I mean, if she wants earlier, I can do 8:00 AM. But realistically, because it's it'll be a very simple process for me, she can really come in any time between 8:00 and 10:00.  
Patient: Oh, OK, great.  
Agent: All right. Wonderful. So should we set an appointment or No,  
Agent: You'll just, I'll go ahead and set one, but just tell her, you know it. It's it'll be very quick. It's just as soon as he pees for me, she's good to go.  
Patient: OK, Perfect. Wonderful.

Agent: OK, typically with bite wounds, I would recommend bringing them in just because there is always a chance of infection. Umm, with it not being so deep, that's obviously a good thing. Like the deeper it goes, more of a chance there is for infection. But he's really sensitive to touch in that area. Then it's probably best, uh, bring him in so we can take a look at it, probably scrub the area and then probably send you home with some antibiotics to help maybe in some pain medications.  
Patient: OK. Perfect. You guys have anything available today?  
Agent: Yeah, let me look. MMM, today we could do. 11:00 or 11:30 if you wanted to go earlier or if you wanted to do in the afternoon, we could do one. Or 1:30 or any time between 3:00 and 5:00.

Agent: Yeah, it looks like I would need to see you guys for a Wellness visit before I'd be able to get you guys more food.  
Patient: Oh, darn. OK. Is that tip, is that normal for all vets? Because we've never, we've never had this problem before.

Patient: OK. Because when when he first got diagnosed with the reason why he has to have this food, the prescription is written for a lifetime. So does that not?  
Agent: That's pretty weird. Typically the prescription is unlimited for one year.  
Patient: OK, so that's not how his prescription's written. So do I need to get  
Agent: That would have been a mistake because yeah, I every prescription I've ever done for food, it's it's PRN, which is basically unlimited. Umm, and for the like amount of time, it's for one year. So you can get as much as you want for one year. It's just Texas State law dictates I do have to see you once a year. There's really not a way for me to go around that.  
Patient: OK, well, that's strange because literally since he's been prescribed it, we've never had to. We get. That's it, TCAP that we've never been told that for, like as long as he's been on the medicine. So are the prescription food. But that's good to know. All right. Thank you.  
Agent: I had seen you guys back in December, 20 or August of 23. So I was able to get it for you guys up until August of 24. But now I do have to see you guys.

And she, umm, wanted him to go, uh, on that royal canine gastrointestinal. Uh-huh. I have called Taylor 12 pet supply stores and I can't find it. Uh, either PetSmart or Petco. Right, neither 1. So then what? At that point, we would suggest that you'd order it on Chewy. Do did I do what you'd order it on chewy.com. OK. So I probably won't be able to get it till tomorrow. That's OK. So tonight, what should I do for him because he hasn't eaten since yesterday. As far as tonight, I would get some canned chicken, make sure there's no sodium in it, just like that canned chicken next to the tuna in the grocery store and some white rice. Boil it and just offer him small amounts of that until you get the cans in because that's pretty much what we would do in the ER, 100%. And I'm not, I'm the redhead. I'm one of the emergency technicians. OK. All right, I appreciate that. OK, so canned chicken, umm. If it does have sodium in it because it's got to be stinky, but that's exact stuff we do for both cats and dogs in the ear. OK and what if I washed it off if I have some in my pantry and washed it off? Does that work? No. No, because it was already sitting in the salt. Yeah. OK. OK. So no sodium and then white rice. Boil it and then mix it all together. Yeah. We always say white rice. I mean, brown rice. Sure, go for it. But it's just easier to just. I think it's cheaper for white rice. OK. Alright.
